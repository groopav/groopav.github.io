Physical quantum computers are highly sensitive and prone to errors caused by noise. These errors can arise from manufacturing imperfections, environmental interactions, faulty gates, cross-talk, and more. Overcoming these challenges to build practical quantum computers relies heavily on effective Quantum Error Correction (QEC).

## Coherence Error
In classical computing, a bit can have two values - 0 and 1. So the only kind of error possible is a bit flip 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0.

A qubit can be represented as a continuum of values between its basis states :

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
$$

Alternatively, using geometric representation:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|1\rangle
$$

where 

$$|\cos\frac{\theta}{2}|^2 + |e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|^2 = 1$$.

This gives rise to a variety of errors.

Coherence errors occur when the qubit coherently rotates on the Bloch sphere. They are represented by the unitary operation:

   $$
   U(\delta\theta, \delta\phi)|\psi\rangle = \cos\frac{\theta + \delta\theta}{2}|0\rangle + e^{i(\phi + \delta\phi)}\sin\frac{\theta + \delta\theta}{2}|1\rangle
   $$

or

   $$
   U(\delta\theta, \delta\phi)|\psi\rangle = \alpha_{I}I|\psi\rangle + \alpha_{X}X|\psi\rangle + \alpha_{Z}Z|\psi\rangle + \alpha_{XZ}XZ|\psi\rangle
   $$

using the Pauli gates. Note how any coherent error can be broken down into a sum from the Pauli set $$\{I, X, Z, XZ\}$$.

For a error code to correct this set of errors, it is sufficient for it to correct the two types of erors - bit flip (X) and phase flip (Z) -

$$
X|\psi\rangle = \alpha|1\rangle + \beta|0\rangle
$$

and

$$
Z|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle - \beta|1\rangle
$$

## Classical Error Correction
Classical error correction relies on redundancy to safegaurd against errors. For example, consider the classical 3-bit repetition code. This code just transmit the same error three times, and the receiver takes the most frequently occuring bit. Example, if Alice sends (0,0,0) and Bob received (0,1,0) then Bob would interpret it as 0.

$$
P[correct\ transmission] = (1-p)^3 + 3(1-p)^2p
$$

where $$p$$ is the probability of one individual bit getting incorrectly transmitted.

## Challenges in Quantum Error Correction - 
1. No cloning theorem - A qubit can't be encoded as $$ |\psi\rangle \rightarrow |\psi\rangle|\psi\rangle $$.
2. Measurement is destructive - measurement collapses a qubit to the basis state.
3. Quantum error codes need to account for both bit flips (X) and phase flips (Z) whereas classical error codes need to work only for bit flips.
4. A quantum state is comparable to an analog state. It is possible for a qubit to move just a little bit on a Bloch sphere without completely experiencing a bit flip or a phase flip. QEC should account for this.

## Shor's Bit flip code
As the No-Cloning theorem prevents one from replicating qubit, quantum error codes use entanglement to add redundancy. This can be better explained by considering Shor's 3-bit Bit Flip code.

![Shor's 3-Qubit Bit Flip Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groopav/groopav.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/Shor'sBitFlip.png)

The Shor's bit flip code begins with a qubit $$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$ and two additional qubits in the $$|0\rangle$$ state(0). The qubit is entangled with the two other qubits(1). Let there be a bit flip error on q0, causing the entangled state to become $$ \alpha|100\rangle + \beta|011\rangle $$ (2). At this point, two ancilla bits are used to measure the parity of the encoded bits. q3 measures the parity of q0q1, and q4 measures the parity of q1q2 (3). Based on the measured syndrome (q3q4), we can identify the location of the bit flip error using Table - 1. The error correction circuit uses the syndrome bits as control and fixes the bit flip error (4) and finally, the value of $$|\psi\rangle$$ is retrieved by disentangling the three qubits (5). It should be noted that, even though two ancilla bits are used in error detection, the error correction circuit contains only 3 qubits and the two ancilla bits can be freed at this stage. So this is called a 3-bit code.

## Shor's Phase flip code

![Shor's 3-Qubit Phase Flip Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groopav/groopav.github.io/refs/heads/main/images/Shor'sPhaseFlip.png)
The Phase flip code is very similar to the Bit flip code, except that it uses Hadamard's to conver the Phase flip errors into bit flip errors.
